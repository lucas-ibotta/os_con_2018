# OSCON2018

* 2 Day tutorials were in depth and helpful! (and sometimes over my head). WORTH IT.
* 2 Days of conference talks that generally helpful, but not as in depth. STILL WORTH IT.

## Conference has a code of conduct but...
  * It's been controversial in the days leading up to the conference for adding "political affiliation" as a protected class. See [this blog](https://medium.com/@nebrius/why-i-wont-be-speaking-at-oscon-575fde0c2abd)
  * And was removed (see [Tim O'Reilly's response](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/political-speech-conference-codes-conduct-tim-o-reilly/?published=t))
  * But some speakers still dissented and removed their talks, but still attended it seems?

## Diversity
* This was a central topic of keynotes and theme of an entire luncheon.
* Gender neutral bathrooms
* Portland is great.

## Conference in General
* Lots of big names and Open Source contributors here giving talks
* Focus on microservices, open source and blockchain technology is very useful
* Talks given by sponsors are noted in the schedule! Love that.
* Expensive, but most folks are sponsored by companies to be here.
* EFF is here selling anti NSA stickers. Aaaaand the NSA is here too?
