# SDKs in Seven Languages
* Elmer Thomas & Sendgrid
* @thinkingserious
* DX@sendgrid.com (team email)
* "Septalingual Member of the Maintainerati"
* One engineer to refactor 235 endpoints in 7 APIs in 7 languages

## Choosing languages
  * Do only one language at a time.
  * interview your customers / developers
  * Survey them too
  * Github research
  * Page tracking on your documentation pages by language
  * Utilize your user agents

## Coming up to speed in 7 languages
  * Determine your optimum learning style
  * Take 2 weeks as a learning sprint
  * start with philosophy and proceed to fundamentals of the language
  * discover the key people in the community
  * build a native HTTP client from scratch in the language
    * reduced depencies to nil and always use languages native HTTP client
  * Explore quality SDKs from top-tier API providers in the language
    * But don't go too deep

## Automating
### Yes to automate:
  * (OpenAPI Spec as source of truth for all this)
  * Documentation
  * Integration Tests
  * Examples
  * Low Level Code
  * CLA (which sucks) - "I had to fax a company a CLA"
    * CLAAssistant.io uses Github Auth as a method of auth. Boom.
  * Swag for contribution. Codis has a swag API.
  * Github interactions. Probot?
  * SWAGGER

### What to NOT automate
  * HTTP Client
  * Helpers - it has to be done by hand with community support.
  * README.md
  * Getting Started Docs - Twillio docs are a good example
  * Use Case Docs
  * Troubleshooting Docs
  * Contributing Docs
  * Unit Tests
  * Semver Versioning


## Community Collaboration
  * Hacktoberfest - a Github & Digital Ocean project
  * Well defined issues makes such a big difference
  * @tag the right folks to get their input
  * the angry folks are passionate. leverage that into making those changes, turn detractors into fans.

## Prioritization
* Used to use JIRA and that was super painful.
* Started a backlog in Google Sheets, since it has an API
* Scrumban - segmented time
  * Community
  * Automation
* Intercom system: RICE - a system to weight items in your backlog
  * Reach - the footprint f this code
  * Impact (s/m/l)
  * Confidence - can we fix it?
  * E-Something!

## A Day in the Life of a Developer Experience Engineer
* Pomodoro Method (25 mins of LASER focus, 5 min break)
* Meeting Prep
  * He always makes an agenda.
* Admin tasks
  * Calendar, Email, Slack, Hipchat
* Github
  * Inbox and respond to everything by hand
  * Check automated systems to ensure nothing broke
  * Process intake items in backlog
* Growth Tasks
  * Learning something new so it is part of the day. At least 2 pomodoro times of this a day.
* Automation
  * Fix those annoying things that we should and can automate
* Backlog Work and Product Work
  * different things
* Give Kudos to fellow SD'ers
* Breadcrumbs are left for the next day

## Lifehacks
* text expander for meeting agendas
