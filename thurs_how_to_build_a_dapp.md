# How to build a Dapp
* Faisal Abid
* zoom.ai senior engineer

# DAPP
* decentralized applications in the web3 app
* Any P2P application, like Bittorrent
* combo of three technologies
  * smart contracts
  * whisper protocol
  * IPFS
* remix.ethereum.org

# Smart contracts
* compiles to bytecode that runs on the EVM
* solidity code functions like `payable`
* smart contracts are immutable
  * so if you have a bug and $100 is stuck, you've lost it.
  * it's a new programming paradigm
* you need to deploy it with web3

# There has to be a better way
* Truffle
* Embark (by Status IM)

# Truffle Demo
* package.json
* truffle.js sets the environment you'll deploy to
* Web3 instance is in the JavaScript files
* truffle boxes for angular, react and vue

# Whisper
* send a message and it goes to every machine in the world
* pub/sub style messaging
* allows plausible deniability
* limit is sending a string of a certain size

# Embark
* they're more into the whisper aspect of things
* like truffle

# IPFS
* users can vote to remove files

# DAPPS
